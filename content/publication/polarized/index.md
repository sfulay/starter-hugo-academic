abstract: "While political polarization has increased as measured through surveys, currently we lack comprehensive,
longitudinal, and ecologically valid measurement of the polarization of online political speech that spans
social media platforms. Using language models, we analyze~ 2.5 billion comments on Reddit and
Twitter across ~ 1.7 million accounts from 2007â€“2023 and find that polarized speech has been rising on
both platforms since their inception, with outgroup polarization levels higher on Twitter than Reddit. On
Twitter, while U.S. politicians on the left have been consistently more polarized than everyday users,
politicians on the right experienced the highest growth in polarization, overtaking journalists, media, and
everyday users over the past four years. Today, politicians, the group listened to the most for their political
rhetoric, are far more polarized than everyday users. Additionally, while polarized speech is typically lower
for accounts with more followers, right-leaning political influencers are an exception to this trend, which
may influence perceptions of polarization on the left versus the right. Polarization is more diffuse across
users on Twitter than on Reddit, where it is localized to a few communities. Polarization also varies by
topic, with right-leaning users twice as likely to use polarized rhetoric about immigration as left-leaning
users while left-leaning users are somewhat more likely to be polarized around healthcare. Our large-scale
analysis reveals previously unknown patterns of polarization across platforms, groups, and topics that
will help us better contextualize polarized content and potentially intervene to reduce it."
